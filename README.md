# 16-bit assembly emulator

This project features a 16-bit assembly emulator equipped with a user-friendly GUI. The emulator is designed to replicate the functionality of assembly language, providing a visual representation of the AX, BX, CX, and DX registers on the screen. Users can interact with the emulator through an input interface where they can input assembly instructions.

As of the current implementation, the emulator supports a subset of instructions, including ADD, SUB, and MOV. These instructions allow users to perform basic arithmetic and data movement operations within the simulated 16-bit assembly environment.

The GUI enhances the user experience by offering a clear and intuitive display of register values, making it easier for users to track the state of the system as they execute instructions. The project aims to serve as a practical tool for learning and experimenting with 16-bit assembly language, providing a hands-on experience for users to understand and explore the intricacies of low-level programming.
